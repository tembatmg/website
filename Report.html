              <h2> Reflection on the Portfelio Development Process</h2>
              <p>Creating this website has been an incredibly fulfilling experience. Throughout the process, I enjoyed every step, from design to implementation. This project feels especially meaningful as it allowed me to apply new techniques and strategies I hadn't explored in my previous project. Each page was carefully crafted with passion and attention to detail, and I truly felt amazed by how much I’ve grown in my web design skills.</p>

                <h2>Report</h2>
                <p>The main goal of this portfolio project is to showcase my skills, creativity, and growth as a web designer and developer. I focused on building a website that is user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing, using HTML and CSS. Through this project, I’ve been able to improve my design process, from brainstorming ideas to putting everything together, making sure the final result is polished and of high quality. This portfolio is more than just a collection of my work; it's a reflection of my abilities and serves as a great tool to present myself to future employers, clients, or collaborators. Having a strong portfolio helps me stand out in the professional world, boosts my credibility, and opens up new opportunities for projects and job roles. I’m also really excited to start learning JavaScript in the next part of my semester, as I know it will help me improve my skills even more and allow me to work on more advanced web development tasks. Overall, this project has been an important step in my journey, giving me the skills and confidence I need to take on future challenges in web design and development.</p>
