                <h3>Logo Design</h3>
                <p>A year ago, when I was in Nepal, I was involved in a project focused on designing logos for various companies, groups, and organizations. During this time, I created several unique logos tailored to the specific needs and identities of these entities. My work included developing concepts that reflected the core values and mission of each group, ensuring that the designs were not only visually appealing but also meaningful and impactful.</p>

                <h3>Records Management System of Zoo</h3>
                <p>During my first semester, I studied a module called Software Engineering Fundamentals, where I worked on a project focused on developing a Record Management System for a zoo. The main objective of this project was to create an efficient and organized system for managing the zoo's records, including animal information, staff details, and visitor data. Through this project, I learned not only the technical aspects of designing and implementing a record-keeping system but also the importance of thorough research and planning. I gained valuable insights into the process of developing software that is user-friendly, scalable, and reliable, ensuring that the system could meet the zoo's specific needs and improve overall management efficiency.</p>
