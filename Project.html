                <h3>Logo Design</h3>
                <p>A year ago, when I was in Nepal, I was involved in a project focused on designing logos for various
                    companies, groups, and organizations. During this time, I created several unique logos tailored to
                    the specific needs and identities of these entities. My work included developing concepts that
                    reflected the core values and mission of each group, ensuring that the designs were not only
                    visually appealing but also meaningful and impactful.</p>

                <h3>Records Management System of Zoo</h3>
                <p>During my first semester, I studied a module called Software Engineering Fundamentals, where I worked
                    on a project focused on developing a Record Management System for a zoo. The main objective of this
                    project was to create an efficient and organized system for managing the zoo's records, including
                    animal information, staff details, and visitor data. Through this project, I learned not only the
                    technical aspects of designing and implementing a record-keeping system but also the importance of
                    thorough research and planning. I gained valuable insights into the process of developing software
                    that is user-friendly, scalable, and reliable, ensuring that the system could meet the zoo's
                    specific needs and improve overall management efficiency.</p>

                <p>During my first semester in the Software Engineering Fundamentals course, I was also involved in
                    website development. This experience allowed me to explore various techniques for designing and
                    building functional, user-friendly websites. As part of the project, I developed a website for a
                    zoo, with the primary objective of creating an interactive and informative platform that would
                    enhance user engagement and provide easy access to important zoo-related information.</p>

                <h3>The Chandragiri Hill's Research</h3>
                <p>Chandragiri Hill is a renowned and historically significant tourist destination in Nepal. During my
                    10th grade, I conducted a detailed research project on this majestic hill, exploring its historical,
                    cultural, and geographical importance. Chandragiri holds a special connection with King Prithvi
                    Narayan Shah, the unifier of Nepal, as it is believed to be the site from which he had a clear view
                    of the Kathmandu Valley and strategized the unification of the country. Through my research, I
                    uncovered numerous fascinating aspects of Chandragiri, including its rich history, the significance
                    of its natural beauty, and its importance as a spiritual and cultural landmark. The hill offers
                    breathtaking panoramic views of the Himalayan range, making it a popular spot for both tourists and
                    locals alike. I discovered how the site continues to play a pivotal role in Nepali heritage,
                    blending nature, history, and tradition in a way that captivates the hearts and minds of those who
                    visit.</p>
